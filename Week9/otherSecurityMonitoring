Other things I might want to monitor to ensure the account security

	1: Monitor SignIn Failures to AWS Console
	2: Monitor for IAM user/Roles that had AccessDenied events 
	3: Monitor when the root account is used
	4: Monitor when a source IP address is outside of a certain country
	5: Monitor when a user gets admin privileges
	
     Question #1: Imagine you want to determine whether or not users in your environment have MFA enabled
		   and alert you if there are any that do not. 
		   What boto3 client and functions would you use to determine that information? 

          ****** #1: I would use the IAM Client function called:
		            list_mfa_devices

     Question #2: If you wanted to automate this check, which AWS services would you need to configure? 
		   Add this to your otherSecurityMontiring.txt document.

          ****** #2: Use the IAM Management Console
